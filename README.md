# Readme

Thanks for you participating in Spike/AAG's selection process. This challenge will help us understand the way you face common problems we face at work. Additionally, we will be able to evaluate some technical knowledge.

Some points you should consider before submitting your work:


* This challenge should take you not more than 5 hours of you time. This is a technical challenge which does not have an associated compensation, so we recommend not to invest more time than this.

* What comes after this? After the submition deadline, we have to evaluate the received challenges. This takes us aproximately one week. After that, you will receive feedback and know if you pass to the next stage. If you continue in the process, we will invite you to meet with us, so we can know each other and tell you how the process follows after.

* Finally, read thoroughly the instructions.
